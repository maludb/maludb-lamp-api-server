# Todo — First endpoint: `GET/POST /v1/subjects`

The "first endpoint" is `/v1/subjects` → `html/v1/subjects.php` (requirements.md §4.1).
No endpoint can run without the shared helpers and URL rewriting, so this first
slice also stands up the foundation that all 32 endpoints will reuse.

## ⚠️ Blocking discrepancies (need your decision — see "Open decisions")

The live `zozocal` DB does **not** match `requirements.md`:

| `requirements.md` | Live database |
|---|---|
| table `subjects` | `maludb_subject` |
| `id`, `label`, `type`, `description`, `classifier_md` | `subject_id`, `canonical_name`, `subject_type`, `description`, `classifier_md` |
| join table `subject_verbs` (by subject_id/verb_id) | `maludb_subject_verb` — keyed by **text** (`subject_name`, `verb_name`), 0 rows |
| `api_tokens` w/ `revoked_at`, `token_prefix`, `last_used_at`, `name` | `api_tokens` w/ `expires_at`, `restaurant_id`, `device_name`, **0 rows** |
| logs in `/var/log/maludb/` | dir missing; `/var/log` not writeable by `maludb` user |

## Decisions (confirmed by user 2026-05-26)

1. Build against the live `maludb_*` schema; update `requirements.md` to match. ✔
2. Map `canonical_name AS label` to preserve the client contract. ✔
3. Validate auth against `expires_at`; seed one dev token for testing. ✔

## Plan

- [x] **Foundation — `config/response.php`** (shared, single file, ~<200 lines)
  - `require_auth(): int` — `SELECT user_id FROM api_tokens WHERE token_hash=? AND expires_at > now()` (no `revoked_at` exists). 401 on miss.
  - `body_json()`, `json_response()`, `json_error()` per §2.3 error shape.
  - `db_query` / `db_exec` / `db_one` — PDO wrappers that append every query to `sql.log` (§2.1).
  - `path_id()`, `query_int()`, `query_str()`.
  - Log dir: default `/var/log/maludb/`, **fallback** to a writeable local dir (e.g. `/var/www/var/log/`) when the default isn't writeable, so dev works without root.
- [x] **Foundation — `html/.htaccess`** — the four rewrite rules verbatim from §1.3.
- [x] **Endpoint — `html/v1/subjects.php`**
  - `GET /v1/subjects?q=&limit=` — list subjects; map `subject_id AS id, canonical_name AS label, subject_type AS type`; include `linked_verbs` count from `maludb_subject_verb` (join by `subject_name = canonical_name`); `q` filters `canonical_name`/`description` ILIKE; `limit` default 50 max 200.
  - `POST /v1/subjects` — insert `canonical_name`, `subject_type`, `description`, `classifier_md`; return the created row (201).
  - `405` for other methods.
- [x] **Auth for testing** — seeded dev `api_tokens` row; token `malu_devLOCAL…123` (hash only in DB; user_id=3, restaurant_id=1, 10-year expiry).
- [x] **Test** — curl GET + POST against `php -S`; auth/validation/405 all pass; `sql.log` writes; `?debug=1` block verified; 8/8 rewrite-rule cases match §1.3.
- [x] **Sync docs** — added §4.0 live-schema mapping to `requirements.md`; updated `docs/activity.md`; commit & push.

## Review

**Files added**
- `config/response.php` — the single shared helper for all 32 endpoints: bearer auth
  (against `expires_at`), `body_json`, `json_response`/`json_error`, `db_query`/`db_exec`/`db_one`
  with `sql.log` tracing + `?debug=1` buffer, `path_id`/`query_int`/`query_str`. Log dir
  auto-falls-back to `/var/www/var/log/` when `/var/log/maludb/` isn't writeable.
- `html/.htaccess` — the four §1.3 rewrite rules + an Authorization-passthrough line.
- `html/v1/subjects.php` — `GET` (list, `q`/`limit`, `linked_verbs`) + `POST` (create, 201),
  `405` otherwise.

**Verified** (local `php -S`, dev token): 401 no/bad token · 200 list with correct field
mapping · `q` filter · `?debug=1` SQL trace · 201 create (`id` = MAX+1) · 400 missing-field ·
400 malformed-JSON · 405 PATCH · `sql.log` format per §2.1 · all 8 rewrite examples from §1.3.
Test row removed after verification.

**Notes / follow-ups**
- The dev token is real data in the live `zozocal` DB. Revoke when no longer needed:
  `DELETE FROM api_tokens WHERE device_name = 'claude-dev';`
- `.htaccess` rewriting was validated by replaying the regexes (built-in PHP server ignores
  `.htaccess`); confirm under real Apache before relying on clean URLs in production.
- `linked_verbs` is name-based (`maludb_subject_verb` is currently empty, so all counts are 0).
- `subject_id` has no sequence — the `MAX(subject_id)+1` insert is fine for v1 but not
  concurrency-safe; revisit if subjects are created in parallel.
- Left `html/test_db.php` in place (pre-existing; uses MySQL-only `SHOW TABLES`, unrelated to v1).

## Follow-up (2026-05-26) — relationship/pair exposure decision

- Verified live against `https://fastapi.maludb.org` (vhost → `/var/www/html`; user enabled mod_rewrite + AllowOverride so clean URLs resolve).
- **Decision A:** list keeps counts; detail (`/v1/subjects/{id}`) embeds `verbs[]` + `related_subjects[]`; sub-endpoints stay for compat. List also gains a `related_subjects` count.
- [x] Added `related_subjects` count to `GET /v1/subjects` (count of `maludb_subject_relationship` rows where subject is `from`/`to`). Verified live. Documented in `requirements.md` §4.10.
- [x] **Endpoint 2:** `html/v1/subjects_id.php` — `GET` (subject + embedded `verbs[]` + `related_subjects[]`), `PATCH` (label/type/description/classifier_md → 200/400/422/404), `DELETE` (200/404), `405` otherwise. Verified full lifecycle live on a throwaway row. Curl commands added to `tests/subjects_curls.sh`.

# Build plan — remaining 30 endpoints (agreed 2026-05-26)

**Conventions (all phases):**
- Dependency-aware order (below), not strict spec order.
- For **every** endpoint built, also create **one** copy-paste curl test file: `tests/<endpoint>_curls.sh`
  (e.g. `verbs.php` → `tests/verbs_curls.sh`). Plain standalone curl commands, one per case,
  each with an expected-result comment; mutating cases wrapped in a self-cleaning
  create→…→delete flow against `https://fastapi.maludb.org` with the dev token.
- Existing Subjects tests stay as-is (`tests/subjects_curls.sh`, `tests/regression_subjects.sh`);
  the one-file-per-endpoint rule applies to new endpoints only.
- Each endpoint: build → `php -l` → verify live → write its curl file → update `requirements.md`
  mapping if schema differs → log in `docs/activity.md` → commit (+ push when creds available).

**Done:** `subjects.php` ✓, `subjects_id.php` ✓.

## Phase 1 — Verbs (§4.2) ✓ DONE
- [x] `verbs.php` — GET (q/limit, `linked_subjects` count) + POST. + `tests/verbs_curls.sh`
- [x] `verbs_id.php` — GET (+ embedded `subjects[]`) / PATCH / DELETE. + `tests/verbs_id_curls.sh`
- [x] `verbs_id_subjects.php` — GET (read-only linked subjects). + `tests/verbs_id_subjects_curls.sh`
- [x] **Foundation fix (uncovered here):** `maludb_subject`/`maludb_verb` are updatable VIEWS with type-validation triggers. Added a global exception/fatal handler to `config/response.php` (standard JSON error + `api.log` + SQLSTATE→409/422/500 mapping) so bad input returns clean 4xx instead of a blank 500. Verified live (invalid verb_type → 422).

## Phase 2 — Type lists (§4.3) ✓ DONE
- [x] `subject-types.php` — GET (`maludb_subject_type` by `sort_order`; returns `{type,display_name,description,sort_order}`). + `tests/subject-types_curls.sh`
- [x] `verb-types.php` — GET (`maludb_verb_type` by `sort_order`; adds `semantic_class`). + `tests/verb-types_curls.sh`

## Phase 3 — Subjects sub-resources (§4.1) ✓ DONE
- **Decision (2026-05-26):** verb-linking is a vector compartment owned by the DBMS project;
  the API can't create it (multi-table view, no grant, needs embedding config). Related-subjects
  is normal data CRUD on an insertable view. The API does DML only, no DDL.
- [x] `subjects_id_verbs.php` — GET (list linked verbs, works); POST → **501** (deferred). + `tests/subjects_id_verbs_curls.sh`
- [x] `subjects_id_verbs_id.php` — DELETE → **501** (deferred). + `tests/subjects_id_verbs_id_curls.sh`
- [x] `subjects_id_related-subjects.php` — GET + POST `{related_subject_id, relationship_type?}` (default `related_to`; 400/422/409). + `tests/subjects_id_related-subjects_curls.sh`
- [x] `subjects_id_related-subjects_id.php` — DELETE (either direction; 200/404). + `tests/subjects_id_related-subjects_id_curls.sh`
- [x] Wrote `docs/db-requirements.md` — requests `maludb_subject_verb_link`/`_unlink` (granted) from the DBMS project so the verb-link 501s can be lifted later.
- Verified the full related-subjects lifecycle live (link/dupe/self/missing/bidirectional/custom-type/delete); DB left clean.

## Phase 4 — Projects (§4.6) ✓ DONE
- **Finding:** `maludb_project` is a view of `maludb_subject WHERE subject_type='project'` — a project IS a subject (project id = subject_id). No archive column; links live in the non-insertable SVPOR graph. Projects expose `name` (→ canonical_name).
- [x] `projects.php` — GET (q/limit) + POST (create subject type='project'). + `tests/projects_curls.sh`
- [x] `projects_id.php` — GET (+ embedded `subjects[]`/`verbs[]` read from SVPOR edges), PATCH, DELETE (all scoped to type='project'). + `tests/projects_id_curls.sh`
- [x] `projects_id_subjects.php` — POST/PUT → **501** (SVPOR edge not insertable). + test file
- [x] `projects_id_subjects_id.php` — DELETE → **501**. + test file
- [x] `projects_id_verbs.php` — POST/PUT → **501**. + test file
- [x] `projects_id_verbs_id.php` — DELETE → **501**. + test file
- [x] `projects_id_archive.php` — POST → **501** (no archive column). + test file
- [x] `projects_id_unarchive.php` — POST → **501**. + test file
- [x] `docs/db-requirements.md` §2 (project↔subject/verb link functions) + §3 (archive column/functions). Verified all 8 live; DB left clean.

## Phase 5 — Pools (§4.7) ✓ DONE
- **Finding:** `maludb_memory_pool` is direct-INSERT; `pool_id` sequence-assigned; `creation_kind` must be `prompt|api|mcp|sql` (API uses `api`); `lifecycle_state` ∈ `active|sealed|archived|tombstoned`; has `archived_at`. name→pool_name, description→task_objective. **DELETE is permission-denied on the pool view** (consistent w/ no v1 DELETE).
- [x] `pools.php` — GET (q/limit, excludes tombstoned) + POST (creation_kind='api'). + `tests/pools_curls.sh`
- [x] `pools_id.php` — GET + PATCH (name/description); no DELETE → 405. + `tests/pools_id_curls.sh`
- [x] `pools_id_archive.php` — POST sets lifecycle_state='archived'+archived_at; 409 already_archived; 404. + `tests/pools_id_archive_curls.sh`
- Verified full lifecycle live (create/detail/patch/archive/409/405/404). Test pool id=8 left **tombstoned** (can't hard-delete — no grant); flagged to user.

## Phase 6 — Skills (§4.8) ✓ DONE
- **Finding:** `maludb_skill` is a direct-INSERT view, **DELETE works** (clean CRUD); `skill_id` sequence-assigned; defaults version `1.0.0`/visibility `private`/enabled true; visibility ∈ {private,shared,public} & packaging_kind ∈ {system_prompt,markdown,mcp_tool,plugin} (DB-enforced → 422). View exposes no skill body/markdown (db-requirements §4). name→skill_name.
- [x] `skills.php` — GET (`visibility`/`q`/`limit`) + POST. + `tests/skills_curls.sh`
- [x] `skills_id.php` — GET / PATCH / DELETE. + `tests/skills_id_curls.sh`
- [x] `skills_id_duplicate.php` — POST via `maludb_skill_fork` (catches non-forkable → 422); 201 on success. + `tests/skills_id_duplicate_curls.sh`
- Verified full lifecycle live (create/GET/visibility-filter/PATCH/422/DELETE/404); DB left clean (DELETE works). Duplicate happy-path needs a forkable/published source skill.

## Phase 7 — Notes (§4.5) ⏸ DEFERRED (blocked on server-side work)
- **Not built** (user direction 2026-05-26): skip Notes, do Documents next; full server-side
  requirements written in `docs/db-requirements.md` §5 for the user to fix, then we return.
- Blockers verified live: (1) `maludb_memory` writes fail — missing `validate_payload(...)` fn;
  (2) `maludb_quick_add_note` permission-denied (`_upload_document_for_schema`); (3) no issue/
  closed state in the schema; (4) document/note body not exposed by `maludb_document`.
- [ ] `notes.php`, `notes_id.php`, `notes_id_close-issue.php`, `notes_id_reopen-issue.php` — pending DB fixes (db-requirements §5).

## Phase 8 — Documents (§4.4)  ⚠ needs file-storage decision
- [ ] `documents.php` — GET / POST (multipart: file, filename, mime_type, description). + test file
- [ ] `documents_id.php` — GET (metadata) / DELETE. + test file
- **Decision needed here:** where uploaded bytes live (filesystem path vs DB), max size, download path.

## Phase 9 — Episodes (§4.9)  ⚠ open body shape (§6)
- [ ] `episodes.php` — POST only. + test file
- **Decision needed here:** exact JSON body shape (reverse-engineer `createRemoteEpisode`).
