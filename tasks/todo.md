# Todo — First endpoint: `GET/POST /v1/subjects`

The "first endpoint" is `/v1/subjects` → `html/v1/subjects.php` (requirements.md §4.1).
No endpoint can run without the shared helpers and URL rewriting, so this first
slice also stands up the foundation that all 32 endpoints will reuse.

## ⚠️ Blocking discrepancies (need your decision — see "Open decisions")

The live `zozocal` DB does **not** match `requirements.md`:

| `requirements.md` | Live database |
|---|---|
| table `subjects` | `maludb_subject` |
| `id`, `label`, `type`, `description`, `classifier_md` | `subject_id`, `canonical_name`, `subject_type`, `description`, `classifier_md` |
| join table `subject_verbs` (by subject_id/verb_id) | `maludb_subject_verb` — keyed by **text** (`subject_name`, `verb_name`), 0 rows |
| `api_tokens` w/ `revoked_at`, `token_prefix`, `last_used_at`, `name` | `api_tokens` w/ `expires_at`, `restaurant_id`, `device_name`, **0 rows** |
| logs in `/var/log/maludb/` | dir missing; `/var/log` not writeable by `maludb` user |

## Decisions (confirmed by user 2026-05-26)

1. Build against the live `maludb_*` schema; update `requirements.md` to match. ✔
2. Map `canonical_name AS label` to preserve the client contract. ✔
3. Validate auth against `expires_at`; seed one dev token for testing. ✔

## Plan

- [x] **Foundation — `config/response.php`** (shared, single file, ~<200 lines)
  - `require_auth(): int` — `SELECT user_id FROM api_tokens WHERE token_hash=? AND expires_at > now()` (no `revoked_at` exists). 401 on miss.
  - `body_json()`, `json_response()`, `json_error()` per §2.3 error shape.
  - `db_query` / `db_exec` / `db_one` — PDO wrappers that append every query to `sql.log` (§2.1).
  - `path_id()`, `query_int()`, `query_str()`.
  - Log dir: default `/var/log/maludb/`, **fallback** to a writeable local dir (e.g. `/var/www/var/log/`) when the default isn't writeable, so dev works without root.
- [x] **Foundation — `html/.htaccess`** — the four rewrite rules verbatim from §1.3.
- [x] **Endpoint — `html/v1/subjects.php`**
  - `GET /v1/subjects?q=&limit=` — list subjects; map `subject_id AS id, canonical_name AS label, subject_type AS type`; include `linked_verbs` count from `maludb_subject_verb` (join by `subject_name = canonical_name`); `q` filters `canonical_name`/`description` ILIKE; `limit` default 50 max 200.
  - `POST /v1/subjects` — insert `canonical_name`, `subject_type`, `description`, `classifier_md`; return the created row (201).
  - `405` for other methods.
- [x] **Auth for testing** — seeded dev `api_tokens` row; token `malu_devLOCAL…123` (hash only in DB; user_id=3, restaurant_id=1, 10-year expiry).
- [x] **Test** — curl GET + POST against `php -S`; auth/validation/405 all pass; `sql.log` writes; `?debug=1` block verified; 8/8 rewrite-rule cases match §1.3.
- [x] **Sync docs** — added §4.0 live-schema mapping to `requirements.md`; updated `docs/activity.md`; commit & push.

## Review

**Files added**
- `config/response.php` — the single shared helper for all 32 endpoints: bearer auth
  (against `expires_at`), `body_json`, `json_response`/`json_error`, `db_query`/`db_exec`/`db_one`
  with `sql.log` tracing + `?debug=1` buffer, `path_id`/`query_int`/`query_str`. Log dir
  auto-falls-back to `/var/www/var/log/` when `/var/log/maludb/` isn't writeable.
- `html/.htaccess` — the four §1.3 rewrite rules + an Authorization-passthrough line.
- `html/v1/subjects.php` — `GET` (list, `q`/`limit`, `linked_verbs`) + `POST` (create, 201),
  `405` otherwise.

**Verified** (local `php -S`, dev token): 401 no/bad token · 200 list with correct field
mapping · `q` filter · `?debug=1` SQL trace · 201 create (`id` = MAX+1) · 400 missing-field ·
400 malformed-JSON · 405 PATCH · `sql.log` format per §2.1 · all 8 rewrite examples from §1.3.
Test row removed after verification.

**Notes / follow-ups**
- The dev token is real data in the live `zozocal` DB. Revoke when no longer needed:
  `DELETE FROM api_tokens WHERE device_name = 'claude-dev';`
- `.htaccess` rewriting was validated by replaying the regexes (built-in PHP server ignores
  `.htaccess`); confirm under real Apache before relying on clean URLs in production.
- `linked_verbs` is name-based (`maludb_subject_verb` is currently empty, so all counts are 0).
- `subject_id` has no sequence — the `MAX(subject_id)+1` insert is fine for v1 but not
  concurrency-safe; revisit if subjects are created in parallel.
- Left `html/test_db.php` in place (pre-existing; uses MySQL-only `SHOW TABLES`, unrelated to v1).
